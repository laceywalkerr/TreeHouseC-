1. How is C# different from C?
You would always know C being the procedural language while C# is a more object-oriented language. 
The biggest difference is that C# supports automatic garbage collection by Common Language Runtime (CLR) while C does not. 
C# primarily needs a .NET framework to execute while C is a platform-agnostic language. 

2. What is Common Language Runtime (CLR)?
CLR handles program execution for various languages including C#. 
The architecture of CLR handles memory management, garbage collection, security handling. 

3. What is garbage collection in C#?
Garbage collection is the process of freeing up memory that is captured by unwanted objects. When you create a class object, automatically some memory space is allocated to the object in the heap memory. Now, after you perform all the actions on the object, the memory space occupied by the object becomes waste. It is necessary to free up memory. Garbage collection happens in three cases:

If the occupied memory by the objects exceeds the pre-set threshold value.
If the garbage collection method is called
If your system has low physical memory
