1. How is C# different from C?
You would always know C being the procedural language while C# is a more object-oriented language. 
The biggest difference is that C# supports automatic garbage collection by Common Language Runtime (CLR) while C does not. 
C# primarily needs a .NET framework to execute while C is a platform-agnostic language.
