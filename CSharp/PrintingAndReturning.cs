// Return and print are statements, not functions

// Print just shows the human user a string representing what is going on inside the computer.
// The computer cannot make use of that printing.
// Return is how a function gives back a value.
// This value is often unseen by the human user, but it can be used by the computer in further functions.

// return is the main way that a function returns a value.All functions will
// return a value,
//     and
// if there is no
// return statement(or yield but donâ€™ t worry about that yet), it will
// return None.
// The value that is returned by a function can then be further used as an argument passed to another function,
// stored as a variable, or just printed
// for the benefit of the human user.

// Consider these two programs:

//     def function_that_prints():
//     print "I printed"

// def function_that_returns():
//     return "I returned"

// f1 = function_that_prints()
// f2 = function_that_returns()
// print "Now let us see what the values of f1 and f2 are"
// print f1
// print f2
